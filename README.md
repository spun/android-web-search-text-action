Small Android app that adds a configurable "Web search" option to the text selection menu.

## Why
Most Android browsers provide a "Web search" action for selected text. Unfortunately, this is limited to text selected inside the browser, and even there it’s not always available.

I think this option is really useful, and I just wanted to make it available in more places.

## Modes
- Use default search app
- Use browser
    - Select search provider from list
    - Use custom search provider
